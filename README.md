SnapBack transforms complaint handling in fast-paced delivery platforms (Zomato, Swiggy, Blinkit, etc.) by automating resolutions with AI and Web3. Users submit complaints with text/images, validated by vision-language models (VLMs) for accuracy. Approved claims trigger instant refunds or discounts via smart contracts, with proof minted as NFTs.  

**Key Features:**  
- **AI Validation:** Analyze images/text to verify issues like expired groceries or damaged items.  
- **Automated Resolutions:** Smart contracts process refunds instantly, eliminating delays.  
- **NFT Proofs:** Immutable records of resolved complaints for transparency.  
- **Token Rewards:** Earn redeemable tokens for engagement, usable for discounts or perks.  
- **Cross-Platform:** Adaptable to e-commerce (package damage) and grocery (freshness checks).  

**Benefits:**  
- **For Users:** Instant resolutions, token rewards, and tamper-proof records.  
- **For Businesses:** Cut operational costs, streamline processes, and boost trust.  
- **Web3 Integration:** Secure logins via crypto wallets and decentralized data storage (IPFS/Filecoin).  

SnapBack merges AI precision with blockchain transparency to turn frustration into instant satisfactionâ€”no more endless calls or delayed fixes. ðŸš€
